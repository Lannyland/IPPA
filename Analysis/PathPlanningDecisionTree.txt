Notes about hierarchical search:

1. If there's no mode (Uniform)
- Don't do Global Warming. Does no good.

2. If there's 1 mode (Unimodal, Path, Path with splits)
- Don't do Global Warming, Does no good.

3. If there are 2 modes (real, not simple)
- No need to do 3 conv levels for both LHCGWCONV and Top2

4. If there are 3 to 5 modes
- Use TopN 
- Possibly use Hierarchical Search

5. More than 5 modes (lots of modes)
